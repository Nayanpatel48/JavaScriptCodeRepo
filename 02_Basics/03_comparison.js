//in javaScript the equality check == != and comparison <,>,.. arer diffrent things
//=== usage
console.log("2" == 2)//true
//The == operator is the loose equality operator, meaning it performs type coercion. 
// It tries to convert the operands to the same type before making the comparison.

console.log("2" === 2)//false
//The === operator is the strict equality operator. It checks both the value and the 
//type of the operands. If the types are different, it returns false without performing 
//any type conversion.

//the clean code matters the most
